This project aims at realizing underwater navigation by using polarization information. This repository contains python implementation of the single scattering model proposed by Samuel B. Powell et al, and matlab+python implementation of our method. We found that the Angle of Polarization(AOP) map captured underwater is highly related to the sun position, i.e. sun azimuth and sun zenith. We proposed an optimization algorithm to estimate the sun position using skylight AOP map instead of using sunlight polarization information. 

## Data sets
We conducted a toy experiment to capture both sunlight and skylight below the water surface. Part of the captured images could be found under this repository. To get access to the rest of the images, visit the link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/169CHXFxSP_aPJs2WvuOFwCwXODyV_mIq?usp=sharing, and apply for authorization to download the data sets if you find them would be helpful to you.
